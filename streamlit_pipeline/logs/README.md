# Pipeline Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the GraphJudge Streamlit Pipeline for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Log Directory Structure

The logs are organized by date and phase for easy navigation:

```
logs/
├── YYYY_M_DD/              # Daily log folders (e.g., 2025_9_14)
│   ├── pipeline/            # Main pipeline orchestration logs
│   ├── ectd/               # Entity extraction and text denoising logs
│   ├── triples/            # Triple generation logs
│   └── judgment/           # Graph judgment logs
└── README.md
```

### Log Files per Phase

Each phase directory contains:
- `{phase}_{timestamp}.log` - Main phase execution logs (DEBUG level)
- `{phase}_{timestamp}.json` - Structured JSON logs for analysis
- `{phase}_{timestamp}_errors.log` - Error-specific logs
- `{phase}_{timestamp}_summary.json` - Session summary and statistics

### Phase-Specific Logs

The pipeline generates phase-specific log entries with prefixes:

- `[ENTITY]` - Entity extraction and text denoising (ECTD stage)
- `[TRIPLE]` - Triple generation stage
- `[JUDGMENT]` - Graph judgment stage
- `[PIPELINE]` - Overall pipeline orchestration
- `[STORAGE]` - File storage operations
- `[API]` - API call details

## Log Levels

- **DEBUG** - Detailed debugging information, API requests/responses
- **INFO** - General pipeline progress and results
- **WARNING** - Non-fatal issues that should be monitored
- **ERROR** - Errors that cause stage failures
- **CRITICAL** - Critical errors that halt the entire pipeline

## Log Format

Each log entry follows this format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | LEVEL    | module:function:line | message
```

## Log Rotation

Log files are created daily and will accumulate over time. Consider implementing log rotation or cleanup policies as needed.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Triple Generation Issues**: Look for `[TRIPLE]` entries showing:
   - Input entities and text chunks
   - API response validation
   - Schema parsing results
   - Final triple counts

2. **Entity Extraction Issues**: Check `[ENTITY]` entries for:
   - Input text validation
   - API call success/failure
   - Extracted entity lists
   - Text denoising results

3. **API Failures**: Search for `[API]` entries and ERROR level logs for:
   - Connection timeouts
   - Rate limiting
   - Invalid responses
   - Authentication issues

4. **Storage Issues**: Look for `[STORAGE]` entries for:
   - File creation/write failures
   - Directory permissions
   - Path resolution problems

## Privacy Note

Log files may contain text snippets and entity data for debugging purposes. Ensure appropriate access controls are in place for production deployments.
