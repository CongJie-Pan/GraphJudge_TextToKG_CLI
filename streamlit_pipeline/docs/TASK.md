## Project Overview and Constraints

### Global Dependencies
- **API Access**: Valid OpenAI and Perplexity API keys
- **Development Environment**: Python 3.8+, Git access, testing frameworks
- **Reference Materials**: Access to original `chat/` scripts for analysis

### Task Completion Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Each task must follow this completion protocol before being marked as complete in TASK.md:

1. **Unit Test Execution**:
   - Run all unit tests for the implemented module: `pytest tests/test_[module_name].py -v`
   - All tests must pass (0 failures, 0 errors)
   - Achieve minimum 90% test coverage as specified in `docs/Testing_Demands.md`

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify module integrates correctly with existing components
   - Test API integrations with mocked responses
   - Validate data flow between components

3. **Debugging and Issue Resolution**:
   - Resolve all identified bugs, errors, and warnings
   - Fix any linting or type checking issues
   - Ensure code follows project coding standards

4. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Ensure all deliverables are complete and documented
   - Verify API documentation matches implementation
   - Update any relevant documentation

5. **Final Verification**:
   - Module can be imported without errors
   - All interfaces work as specified in spec.md
   - Performance meets acceptance criteria

6. **Task Status Update**:
   - Only after ALL above steps are complete, update task status in TASK.md
   - Mark task as **completed** with completion timestamp
   - Document any issues resolved during testing

### Success Criteria
- **Code Reduction**: 70%+ reduction in lines of code per module
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ unit test coverage for all refactored modules
- **Functionality Parity**: All essential NLP capabilities preserved
- **User Experience**: Simplified execution compared to CLI scripts

### Risk Mitigation
- **R-01**: Complex refactoring → Incremental approach with frequent testing
- **R-02**: API integration issues → Comprehensive mocking and error handling  
- **R-03**: Performance degradation → Regular benchmarking against original scripts

### Timeline Summary
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks (20 working days)
- **Phase 1**: 5 days (Core module extraction)
- **Phase 2**: 6 days (Triple generation refactoring)
- **Phase 3**: 6 days (Graph judge simplification)  
- **Phase 4**: 5 days (Streamlit integration)

**Note**: Each task includes mandatory testing and debugging time. Timeline assumes:
- 70% time for implementation
- 30% time for testing, debugging, and verification
- Tasks marked complete only after full Testing Protocol completion
