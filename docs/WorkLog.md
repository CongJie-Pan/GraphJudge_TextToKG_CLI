1. Although today try to use more strict and practicle process to debug, the error of the cli still happening again.(Maybe is the original code quality is not well, spending lots of time on the debugging and AI Coding made the codes more complicated.) Like below:
```

So, for the sake of just combine function of the `run_entity.py` and `run_triple.py` and `run_gj.py` to be a pipeline, tentively abandon the cli plan. Change to the streamlit plan, change to use streamlit to implement this function will be more smoothly to accomplish AI Function.
