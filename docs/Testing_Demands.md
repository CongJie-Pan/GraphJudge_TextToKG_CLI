# Testing Requirements and Guidelines for AI Development

## Core Testing Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Write tests first, implement later** - Follow TDD principles to ensure interface design consistency
- Define expected behavior through tests before writing implementation code
- Use tests as living documentation of system requirements and expected behavior

### Architectural Consistency
- **Ensure alignment between tests and implementation** - Tests must use the same calling patterns as the actual implementation
- Document class relationships clearly (composition vs inheritance vs static calls) in architecture design
- Conduct code review checkpoints to verify test-implementation consistency
- If tests expect `object.attribute.method()`, implementation must provide that exact interface
- If implementation uses static methods `Class.method()`, tests should mirror this pattern

## Test Structure and Organization

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc)
- **Update existing tests when logic changes** - After any logic modification, verify and update related tests
- Tests should live in a `/tests` folder mirroring the main application structure

### Minimum Test Cases
Each feature must include at least:
- **1 test for expected use case** - Normal, successful operation
- **1 edge case test** - Boundary conditions, unusual but valid inputs
- **1 failure case test** - Invalid inputs, error conditions, exception handling

## Test Design Best Practices

### Mock and Test-Friendly Design
- **Use module-level variables for aligned test mock paths** - Ensure mocks target the correct import paths
- **Access and call objects meaningfully** - Don't just import to confirm existence; actually invoke methods to match mock design
- **Trigger actual mock behavior** - Use real calls/await statements to activate mock responses
- **Design for testability** - Structure code to allow easy mocking and testing

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- **Path checking independence** - Don't rely on OS-specific path interpretation
- **Explicitly reject special paths** for testing purposes
- Ensure tests behave identically across different operating systems

### Simplicity and Robustness
- **Apply the "condense principle"** - Make minimal, targeted changes
- **Implement clear error handling** with predictable error messages
- **Ensure predictable return values** - Avoid non-deterministic test outcomes
- **Handle initialization order carefully** - Critical attributes must be initialized before validation that might raise exceptions

## Common Pitfalls and Prevention

### Cache-Related Issues
- **Python module caching** can hide code modifications during development
- Clear caches regularly during development: `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache`
- Force module reloading in test environments when necessary
- Be aware that unsaved changes in editors may not be reflected in test runs

### Attribute and Object Testing
- **Test attribute existence explicitly** - Use `hasattr()` checks for critical attributes
- **Verify object initialization completeness** - Ensure all required attributes are properly initialized
- **Test object state consistency** - Verify objects maintain expected state throughout operations

### Integration Testing
- **Test module interactions** - Verify that different modules work together correctly
- **Data flow consistency** - Ensure data remains consistent as it flows between modules
- **Configuration propagation** - Test that settings properly propagate through integrated systems

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Comprehensive Error Testing
- Test error propagation across module boundaries
- Verify graceful handling of file system errors
- Test configuration error scenarios (missing API keys, invalid settings)
- Ensure error messages are clear and actionable

### Debugging Support
- Structure tests to provide meaningful failure information
- Include debug information in test assertions
- Design tests that help isolate problems when they occur
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested

## Performance and Memory Considerations

### Performance Testing
- Test batch processing performance with realistic data sizes
- Verify memory usage stability during extended operations
- Test concurrent operations and race conditions where applicable
- Ensure acceptable throughput for expected workloads

### Resource Management
- Test proper cleanup of resources (files, connections, etc.)
- Verify that temporary files and directories are properly removed
- Test behavior under resource constraints

## Documentation and Maintenance

### Test Documentation
- Use clear, descriptive test method names
- Include docstrings explaining test purpose and expected behavior
- Document any special setup or teardown requirements
- Maintain test documentation alongside code changes

### Test Maintenance
- Regular review of test relevance and effectiveness
- Remove or update obsolete tests
- Ensure test suite execution time remains reasonable
- Monitor test flakiness and address unstable tests promptly

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before considering any feature complete:
- [ ] All new functionality has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests cover normal, edge, and failure cases
- [ ] Test-implementation architectural consistency verified
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Error handling thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Documentation updated accordingly
- [ ] Code review completed with focus on test quality

Remember: **Prevention is better than debugging** - Well-designed tests and consistent development practices prevent most debugging scenarios.
