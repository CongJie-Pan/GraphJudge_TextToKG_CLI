## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### File Path Issue Resolution

**Problem Identified**:
```
🎉 GPT-5-mini ECTD pipeline completed successfully for Iteration 4!
❌ Output files not found in either location:
   Primary: ..\datasets\KIMI_result_DreamOf_RedChamber\Graph_Iteration4
   Legacy: D:\...\docs\Iteration_Report\Iteration4\results\ectd
```

**✅ Solution Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Validation Logic**:
   ```python
   def _validate_stage_output(self, stage_name: str, env: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:
       # Check multiple potential locations including actual working directory
       actual_output_locations = [
           os.path.join(current_working_dir, "../datasets/KIMI_result_DreamOf_RedChamber", f"Graph_Iteration{iteration}"),
           primary_output_dir,
           legacy_output_dir
       ]
   ```

2. **Pipeline State Management**:
   ```python
   # Initialize pipeline state for inter-stage communication
   self.pipeline_environment_state = {}
   
   # Store validated path for subsequent stages
   self.pipeline_environment_state['VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR'] = working_location
   ```

3. **Inter-Stage Communication**:
   ```python
   # Use validated output from previous stage
   if stage_name == "triple_generation" and 'VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR' in self.pipeline_environment_state:
       env['TRIPLE_INPUT_DIR'] = self.pipeline_environment_state['VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR']
   ```

### GraphJudge Phase Integration

**✅ Enhanced Stage Manager Configuration**:
```python
def configure_enhanced_stage(self, stage_name: str, mode_config: Dict[str, Any]):
    if stage_name == 'graph_judge' and isinstance(stage, GraphJudgePhaseStage):
        # Enhanced GraphJudge Phase integration with modular architecture support
        if hasattr(stage, 'configure_modular_system'):
            stage.configure_modular_system(mode_config)
            print(f"  ✓ GraphJudge Phase modular system configured")
```

**✅ Modular Component Support**:
```python
def get_modular_capabilities(self) -> List[str]:
    return [
        'explainable-reasoning',
        'gold-label-bootstrapping', 
        'streaming',
        'modular-architecture',
        'perplexity-integration',
        'batch-processing',
        'confidence-scoring',
        'citation-support'
    ]
```

## 🚀 COMPLETE Production-Ready Features

### ✅ Robust Error Handling - IMPLEMENTED

1. **Multiple Path Checking for File Validation**
   ```python
   # Enhanced validation checks actual working directory, primary, and legacy locations
   actual_output_locations = [
       os.path.join(current_working_dir, "../datasets/KIMI_result_DreamOf_RedChamber", f"Graph_Iteration{iteration}"),
       primary_output_dir,
       legacy_output_dir
   ]
   ```

2. **Graceful Fallback to Legacy Implementations**
   ```python
   # Enhanced stages with automatic fallback
   if ENHANCED_STAGES_AVAILABLE and GraphJudgePhaseStage:
       stages['graph_judge'] = GraphJudgePhaseStage(self.config.graph_judge_phase_config or {})
   else:
       stages['graph_judge'] = GraphJudgeStage(self.config.graph_judge_phase_config or {})
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Error Logging and Reporting**
   ```python
   print(f"🔍 Checking location: {location}")
   for f in files_to_check:
       exists = os.path.exists(f)
       size = os.path.getsize(f) if exists else 0
       print(f"   {'✓' if exists and size > 0 else '✗'} {os.path.basename(f)} ({size} bytes)")
   ```

### ✅ Inter-Stage Communication - IMPLEMENTED

1. **Pipeline Environment State Management**
   ```python
   # Store validated paths for subsequent stages
   self.pipeline_environment_state['VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR'] = working_location
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Continuity**
   ```python
   # Apply pipeline state from previous stages
   env.update(self.pipeline_environment_state)
   
   # Use validated output directory from previous stage
   if stage_name == "triple_generation" and 'VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR' in self.pipeline_environment_state:
       env['TRIPLE_INPUT_DIR'] = self.pipeline_environment_state['VALIDATED_ECTD_OUTPUT_DIR']
   ```

### ✅ Modular Architecture Support - IMPLEMENTED

1. **Full GraphJudge Phase Integration**
   ```python
   def configure_modular_system(self, mode_config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
       # Update core configuration
       if 'explainable_mode' in mode_config:
           self.explainable_mode = mode_config['explainable_mode']
       # Reinitialize components with updated configuration
       self._initialize_components()
   ```

2. **Runtime Configuration Capabilities**
   ```python
   def update_configuration(self, config_update: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
       self.config.update(config_update)
       self.configure_modular_system(config_update)
   ```
