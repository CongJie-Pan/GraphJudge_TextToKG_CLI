"""
Simplified Unit Tests for KIMI-K2 Graph Judge Implementation

This test suite provides basic validation of the run_kimi_gj.py module functionality
without complex dependency management. It focuses on testing the core logic and
integration patterns.

Test Coverage:
- Basic function validation and structure
- Configuration integration testing
- File I/O operations simulation
- Response format validation
- Error handling patterns

Run with: pytest test_run_kimi_gj_simple.py -v

You need to do the graph judgement task, which means you need to clarify
 the correctness of the given triple.
Attention:
1.The correct triple sentence should have a correct grammatical structure.
2.The knowledge included in the triple sentence should not conflict with
the knowledge you have learned.
3.The answer should be either "Yes, it is true." or "No, it is not true."

Here are two examples:
Example#1:
Question: Is this true: Apple Founded by Mark Zuckerberg ?
Answer: No, it is not true.
Example#2:
Question: Is this true: Mark Zuckerberg Founded Facebook ?
Answer: Yes, it is true.
